# Frontend Module

The frontend is built on the NextJS framework.

The `frontend` module requires its own set of environment variables.
Refer to the `.env.example.local` file for details on the formatting of the file and values required.

As always, the recommendation is to use a proper IDE that can help you set up the environment variables before running any
build or run commands.
