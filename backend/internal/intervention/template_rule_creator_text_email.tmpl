Dear {{ if .CreatorInfo.Name }}{{ .CreatorInfo.Name }}{{ else }}{{ .CreatorInfo.Email }}{{ end }},

Today's automated attendance rule checking is complete.

The report for each of your rules are shown below:
{{ range .RuleAndUsers }}- [{{ .Rule.ClassCode }}, {{ .Rule.ClassYear }}/{{ .Rule.ClassSemester }}] {{ .Rule.Title }}
{{ range .FailedUsers }}    - {{ printf "%-15s" .ID }} | {{ or .Name "<No name registered>" | printf "%-25s" }} | {{ or .Email "<No email registered>" }}
{{ end }}{{ end }}
The students have also been contacted by OAMS regarding their failure to meet your defined rules.
You may wish to personally contact them to take follow-up actions.

Have a nice day.

OAMS
